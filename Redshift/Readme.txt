All about our redhift determination is here.
Kostas sent this link for theoritical wavelength lines
http://classic.sdss.org/dr6/algorithms/linestable.html

It says smth about weight there. That's why there is also a weighted mean in redshift.ods file. Asked Kostas about it-hasn't replied yet.
He replied. Forget about weights. I changed redshift.ods accordingly
